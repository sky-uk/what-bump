## Contributing to what-bump

Thank you for your interest in what-bump! There are multiple ways you can contribute to this project. We welcome contributions in all areas, with special attention to:

* [Issue fixes](#issue-fixes)
* [Improvements and new features](#improvements)
* [Documentation improvements](#documentation-improvements)

Please take the time to carefully read the following guide. These rules help make the best out of your time, the code reviewer's time and the general consistency of the project.

### General rules

All contributions are handled via Pull Requests (PRs). Your PR _must_ target the `develop` branch. This is the place where we aggregate all upcoming changes for the next release of what-bump. Moreover, your PR _must_ provide a meaningful description of what it is about.

We suggest using ([Gitflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) branching model).

You _should_ format your commit message according to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). When merging, all commits from your branch will be squashed, and the exact wording of the commit message will be decided. 

Quick checklist summary before submitting a PR:

* üîé Make sure your changes have tests. Even if at the moment there are no tests, we plan to add them to the code-base, and don't want to add any more untested production code. When possible, add tests to verify bug fixes and prevent future regressions.
* üëå Verify that tests pass
* üëç Push it!

### Issue fixes

Fixing issues is a good way to start contributing and getting used to the large codebase in project! You may want to look at outstanding reported issues, or maybe you bumped into an issue that you found. In the latter case, please make sure you first open an issue in the issue tracker here on GitHub and indicate that you're working on a fix. This will give a chance to other contributors to chime in, and help tracking who's working on what in order to avoid duplicate work.

Once you believe the issue is fixed, make sure the tests pass (see above) then open a Pull Request.

Congratulations on contributing a fix! We love receiving new bug fixes and your help is very much welcomed.

### Improvements

Describe what you'd like to see wfrom the community.

### Documentation improvements

We understand the need for foreign language documentation. Unfortunately, due to the scope and breadth of the project it's a tough promise to keep up-to-date documentation in other languages than English. Moreover, all contributors only have English as a common language on the project. Therefore, and to keep the project as maintainable as possible, we only accept documentation changes and improvements provided in English. If you're looking at providing a translation of the in-line documentation, please make sure you have the resources and time to keep it updated as the framework changes. We care a lot about the quality of both the code and its documentation, over the long term. Maintaining a foreign language translation is a longtime commitment that should not be taken lightly.

Thank you for your interest in helping with documentation! Your contributions will make the life of other developers easier.
